# Reference Material for Microservices

This document contains some pointers to material that is useful for understanding and working with the Microservice architectural style. It will be updated periodically.

## Concepts
|Title|Description|
|---|---|
|[Microservices - a definition](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)|The definitive article by James Lewis and Martin Fowler, that provides a definition for this architectural style. Includes the famous "characteristics of a microservice architecture."|
|[Articles from MartinFowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/tags/microservices.html)|A series of informative articles about Microservices. Includes some interesting ones, even with opposing viewpoints such as [Monolith First](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html) and [Donâ€™t start with a monolith](https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-start-monolith.html).|
|[Microservices trade-offs](https://highscalability.com/microservices-not-a-free-lunch/)|An examination of some of the significant complexities that the Microservice style can bring in.|

## Planning
|Title|Description|
|---|---|
|[Domain Driven Design for Microservices](https://www.sayonetech.com/blog/domain-driven-design-microservices/)|A short guide for using DDD patterns and practices for projects using the Microservice architecture.|
|[Using domain analysis to model microservices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/domain-analysis)|An example, with a reference implementation, of the same.|
|[Domain Driven Design with Context Mapping](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping/)|Context mapping is a DDD pattern that can be useful for the Microservice architectural style, especially because it includes non-software aspects.|
|[The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/)|The C4 model is an easy to learn, developer friendly approach to software architecture diagramming.|

## APIs
|Title|Description|
|---|---|
|[What is OpenApi](https://nonamesecurity.com/learn/what-is-openapi/)|An introduction to the OpenAPI Specification, and how to define APIs with it.|
|[The OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)|The formal specification.|
|[Stoplight Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism)|A popular API prototyping and mocking tool.|
